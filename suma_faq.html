            <p>You can collaborate with the neighbouring RWA and get them on board to cover some part of their jurisdiction as well to cover 1000 households. The 1000 households is an indicative number to ensure that the area chosen is not too small. Anywhere between 750-1000 households could be taken into consideration as long as the other elements mentioned are included in this area (commercial/retail street, places of interest such as the parks, lakes etc).

            <p>We urge everyone to take utmost precautions while collecting testimonials if doing a door to door collection of signatures for testimonials.

            <p>The SuMA task force will consist of other government department officials such as BBMP, BTP, BMRCL, BMTC and other departments depending on the kind of projects that the 10 applicants come up with. DULT will act as the nodal agency to ensure all the permissions for the projects that come out through this project can be properly coordinated and implemented. <br>
            The entity which signs the accord, however, is expected to do the groundwork and not just suggest ideas. This project is not to allocate work to the government, but it is for communities to stay involved through the implementation period to ensure that the results are in line with the vision drawn by the neighbourhood. We would urge the communities to have a good base of volunteers and staff the team with people who have the patience to see it through.

                <li>Testimonials from the residents of the area chosen by you are extremely important for understanding if you are able to communicate about the project to them as well as get them involved in your activities. </li>
                <li>Vision - alignment of the vision with the objectives of SuMA</li>
                <li>Details of past engagements through campaigns/programs/implementation on mobility and other urban issues with the government or otherwise. </li>
